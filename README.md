# Salesforce 15-digit to 18-digit Id converter

## Introduction

This repository contains some small code snippets in diffenent programming languages, that all have one purpose: converting Salesforce's case sensitive 15-digit Ids into the 18-digit Ids which aren't case sensitive. This might come in handy if you are working with a file system that isn't case sensitive and you want to write information to a file using the salesforce ids as filename for example.

## Available Versions

 - JavaScript
 - Python
 - Go
 - OpenOffice/LibreOffice Macro
 - Google Spreadsheets script
 - PHP

## Usage

### Adding sf15to18.bas to OpenOffice/LibreOffice

1. Open or create a spreadsheet in OpenOffice/LibreOffice
2. Press *Alt-F11* and create a new Basic Macro
3. Create a new Macro
4. Copy and paste the contents of `sf15to18.bas` to the editor
5. Save the macro
6. Use it in your spreadsheet. If you want to convert the value of *Cell B1*, you need to use the following formula for example: `=sf15to18(B1)`

### Adding sf15to18.gs to Google Spreadsheets

1. Open or create a spreadsheet on Google Spreadsheets
2. Go to *Tools -> Script editor*
3. Select *Blank Project*
4. Copy and paste the contents of `sf15to18.gs` to the script editor
5. Save the script as `sf15to18`
6. Use it in your spreadsheet. If you want to convert the value of *Cell B1*, you need to use the following formula for example: `=sf15to18(B1)`

## How it works

Getting the case insensitive 18-digit Id is an easy process which basically works like this:

1. The 15-digit Id is split into three 5-digit segments.
2. Each of these segments is then reversed.
3. Every uppercase letter is replaced with a 1, every other digit with a 0.
4. The three suffix-digits for the Id can then be looked up in a table, segment by segment (first segment gives the first digit, etc.). The table below shows an excerpt of such a table, which can be easily completed.

### Lookup table

| segment result | suffix digit |
|---|---|
| 00000 | A |
| 00001 | B |
| 00010 | C |
| 00011 | D |
| 00100 | E |
| 00101 | F |
| ... | ... |
| 11010 | 0 |
| 11011 | 1 |
| 11100 | 2 |
| 11101 | 3 |
| 11110 | 4 |
| 11111 | 5 |
